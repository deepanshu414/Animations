## Animation 1
The `css/animation1.css` file contains the CSS code for the first animation in this project. This animation uses CSS transitions and keyframes to create a dynamic and visually appealing effect.

You can view the animation in action by opening the `animation1.html` file in your web browser.

## CSS/Style
The `css/style.css` file contains the general CSS styles used for the `index.html` page, which serves as the main portfolio page for all your animations and projects.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
 ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/deepanshu414/Animations.git

  ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the portfolio page.
